- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe 🏳️‍🌈 + 🏳️‍⚧️ Ally and I'm available to work in person or remotely across the UK.
- 🔬 I developed an interest in software development from my time in academic research and later in clinical diagnostics.
- 🌱 I’m interested in full-stack web applications. To that end I’m currently working with a variety of modern web development tools such as Node.js, SQL, TypeScript and React.js.
- 📚 I have just finished a 3 month intensive web development bootcamp with Northcoders. I am now keeping busy by contributing to personal and team projects and applying to exciting new opportunities. Currently, I am spending some time to become familiar with new technologies such as TypeScript, C# and React Redux.
- 💻 Current Projects: 
 * Single Page React App to enable users to organise their fictional characters using TypeScript and mongoDB : https://github.com/joeglDev/WIP-Character-portfolio
 * React with Redux Dashboard to display weather information to a user using graphing libraries. : https://github.com/joeglDev/redux-weather-app
 * Text based video game in C# : https://github.com/joeglDev/space-colonisation-sim
- ✅ Finished (within reason) Projects:
 * Portfolio website for myself build in Vue with TypeScript : https://joegilbertdeveloper.netlify.app/
 * News website using Node.js, Express.js and React.js to provide a dynamic user experience: https://github.com/joeglDev/nc-news
