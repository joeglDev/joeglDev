- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe (@joeglDev) 🏳️‍🌈 + 🏳️‍⚧️ Ally  and i'm based in Greater Manchester, UK (or remote + a train journey!). 
- 🔬 I developed an interest in software development from my time in academic research and later in clinical diagnostics.
- 🌱 I’m interested in Front End web development frameworks and data visualisation. To that end I’m currently working in a variety of modern languages such as Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
- 📚 On my learning list are modern Front End JavaScript frameworks such as Vue/React and developing my skillsets in data science, use of git etc.
- 💻 Current Projects
 * Tiny React app to enable users to organise their fictional characters.
 * A express.js server which connects a Postgres database to a React front-end webpage. Hosted on Heroku: https://northcoders-backend-project-jg.herokuapp.com/api
