- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe 🏳️‍🌈 + 🏳️‍⚧️ Ally and I'm based in Greater Manchester, UK (or remote + a train journey!). 
- 🔬 I developed an interest in software development from my time in academic research and later in clinical diagnostics.
- 🌱 I’m interested in full-stack web applications and data visualisation. To that end I’m currently working with a variety of modern web development tools such as Node.js, SQL, TypeScript, React.js and Vue.js.
- 📚 I have just finished a 3 month intensive web development bootcamp with Northcoders. I am now keeping busy by contributing to personal and team projects and applying to exciting new opportunities.
- 💻 Current Projects: 
  * Tiny React app to enable users to organise their fictional characters using TypeScript and mongoDB: https://github.com/joeglDev/WIP-Character-portfolio
  * A topic driven messaging service utilising Vue.js and sockets.io: https://github.com/joeglDev/WIP-Tete-a-tete
